                <h2>Is The Future of Front-End Development Bleak?</h2>
                <p>
                    Programmers today entering the virtual jungle that is creating and 
                    designing websites have become worried that front-end development is 
                    dying out. If jobs in that field are still in demand, then why are 
                    novices worried? While front-end development focuses on building the 
                    UI with the basic languages of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the way 
                    people use the internet is also constantly evolving. Today, users are 
                    more concerned with the interactivity of the websites they use, which 
                    means that real-time updates are needed for modern webpages. Using solely 
                    methods that would’ve worked maybe ten or so years ago, this can become a 
                    tedious process that turns out to be a nightmare to program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of this, front-end development has split into two categories of 
                    people. One side focuses on the CSS design, which includes the presentation 
                    of the UI, making sure that the text is standardized, and that the animations 
                    on screen work without fault. On the other side is the logic of the application 
                    that handles the real-time feedback of the webpage, including processing data, 
                    writing and testing JavaScript, and overall, how efficient the website is. In 
                    other words, front-end development isn’t dying out, it is only changing to 
                    keep up with the rolling tide of technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, today experienced developers rarely build webpages from the ground 
                    up with HTML and CSS. They write JavaScript functions that generate the necessary 
                    HTML and CSS. Which means that JavaScript isn’t a tool used just for interactivity,
                    but for ease of programming. Below is an example of adding a 
                    <code id="tag">&lt;p&gt;</code> tag using JavaScript taken from CodeGrepper.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <p>This code adds a <code id="tag">&lt;p&gt;</code> tag,
                        <code id="codeblock">
                            var tag = document.createElement("p");<br> 
                            var text = document.createTextNode("TEST TEXT");<br>
                            tag.appendChild(text);<br>
                            var element = document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0];<br>
                            element.appendChild(tag);<br>
                        </code>
                    </p>
                    <p> While this code generates HTML
                        <code id="codeblock">
                            let elem = document.getElementById("the tag you want to change code of");<br>
                            elem.innerHTML = "&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;p&gt;";<br>
                            document.innerHTML += '&lt;a href=\"youtue.com\">click me !&lt;a&gt;';<br>
                        </code>
                    </p>
                </p>
