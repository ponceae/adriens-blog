                <h2>The Death of the Curly Quote</h2>
                <section>
                <p>In today's web pages, sightings of the curly quote (&ldquo;&rdquo;) 
                have become increasingly rarer. In the early
                days of the World Wide Web (WWW), 7-bit ASCII did not include symbols outside of the 
                English alphabet; including curly quotes. This made it impossible for people in 
                countries outside the U.S. to use characters native to their language. This 
                limitation was eventually bypassed, but required effort from the programmer and the
                user, which was routinely not practiced. In the early 1800's, Linotype keyboards
                included curly quotes. Simultaneously, practical typewriters were 
                manufactured that did not include the curly quote. As equipment upgraded from
                typewriter to keyboard, so did the omission of the curly quote.

                <p>
                Today, the inclusion of curly quotes are dependant on algorithms and ultimately
                programmer decision. In the eyes of the creator, there is no reason to curl the 
                quotation mark. Applications today (such as Apple's News feed) are forced 
                to keep up with the formatting of the quotation mark. As Marcin Wichary, a Polish 
                design lead at Medium says, &ldquo;the lack of Polish&ndash;style quotation marks
                have led the current generation to use American&ndash;style quotes and think the native 
                ones look wrong,&rdquo;. The real question here is if the curly quote will become dominant
                once more, or if in the future people won't even realize the difference anymore.

                    As a visual addition, here is the same quote with different quotation marks, each taking two
                    different levels of effort.
                    <blockquote>"That's no moon. Its a space station."</blockquote>
                    Now with curly quotes:
                    <blockquote>&ldquo;That's no moon. It's a space station.&rdquo;</blockquote>
