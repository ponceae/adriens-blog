        <h2>HTML6 &ndash; When and If?</h2>
        <p>
            The main goal with the release of HTML5 was to empathize the semantics,
            or the meaning behind each HTML tag. Another strong objective was to 
            separate the context of a webpage with its underlying decorative 
            blueprints. This means that HTML5 aims to reduce overlaps between
            the responsiveness of JavaScript, design of CSS, and the words on the 
            page brought about by HTML. These changes were necessary because
            of the ever&ndash;changing web and antiquated coding practices. 
            With all that said, will there ever be a future update to
            HTML5? Enter the prospective HTML6 language.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, according to 
            <a href="https://whatwg.org/" target="_blank">WHATWG</a>
            (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group), there will
            be no HTML6. However, they have adopted a &ldquo;living 
            document&rdquo; approach to updating the language. What this means is that 
            HTML6 will most likely be a series of updates that will occur more 
            frequently as new methods are sought out and implemented. One such update 
            includes the introduction of a &ldquo;native&rdquo;modal window that HTML can use without 
            the assitance of JavaScript. This new <code id="tag">&lt;dialog&gt;</code> element will
            work in conjuction with JavaScript to confirm user action.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another new standardization is the <code id="tag">&lt;menu&gt;</code> and 
            <code id="tag">&lt;button&gt;</code> elements that will create a list of items that 
            the user can interact with. This will make it easier for internet user's who 
            do not use a laptop or desktop, such as a phone, to pick and choose from a list 
            of options.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is an example of the <code id="tag">&lt;button&gt;</code> element.
            <blockquote>
                <menu>
                    <li><button>Pick Me!</button></li>
                    <li><button>No, Me!</button></li>
                    <li><button>Don't Pick Me!</button></li>
                  </menu>
            </blockquote>
                These buttons don't do anything, but it shows how easily you can implement
                some JavaScript functions in HTML. What was addressed earlier was how HTML5 
                aims to &ldquo;reduce overlaps&rdquo;, but who knows how these HTML6 updates
                will affect the status quo of HTML5?
