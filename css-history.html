                <h2>The History of CSS</h2>
                <p>
                    CSS stands for cascading style sheets. One CSS file can 
                    also format multiple HTML files. This is helpful because 
                    imagine having to manualy set the formatting of each 
                    element without a stylesheet, it would be a nightmare.
                    Why is CSS important? Because
                    without it, unformatted text would be vomited onto a page  
                    and become hard to read. However, this is how early webpages
                    looked like, an unformatted mess. Today's webpages are easy
                    to read (if programmed correclty) and CSS is constantly 
                    evolving to keep up with how webpages are displayed.

                    Håkon Wium Lie is responsible for the creation of CSS, who wanted
                    to &ldquo;create a universal standardised style sheer for the 
                    World Wide Web&rdquo; in 1994. Today, Lie continues to attempt
                    to keep CSS up with the times. There are actually three 
                    versions of CSS out today; CSS, CSS2, and CSS3. Similar to 
                    the standardization of HTML5, CSS4 will not be released as 
                    a whole new version, rather it will be constructed as small 
                    updates to CSS as a whole. Without CSS, today's webpages would be 
                    ugly and borderline unreadable.

                    To create your own stylesheet and begin to use CSS, you must first
                    create a .css file and link it to your HTML file using 
                    <code id ="tag">
                    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
                        &lt;link rel="" href=""&gt;
                    </code> 
                    where rel is what is being linked and href being the path
                    to the stylesheet. Then inside of the .css file you declare
                    what tag you are working with and how you want to manipulate 
                    the text, such as 
                    <code id="codeblock">
                    body {
                                background-color: lightgray;
                                font-family: sans-serif;
                    }
                    </code>
                </p>
